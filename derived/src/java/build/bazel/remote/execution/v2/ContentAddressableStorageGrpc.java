/**
 * <pre>
 * The CAS (content-addressable storage) is used to store the inputs to and
 * outputs from the execution service. Each piece of content is addressed by the
 * digest of its binary data.
 * Most of the binary data stored in the CAS is opaque to the execution engine,
 * and is only used as a communication medium. In order to build an
 * [Action][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Action],
 * however, the client will need to also upload the
 * [Command][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Command] and input root
 * [Directory][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Directory] for the Action.
 * The Command and Directory messages must be marshalled to wire format and then
 * uploaded under the hash as with any other piece of content. In practice, the
 * input root directory is likely to refer to other Directories in its
 * hierarchy, which must also each be uploaded on their own.
 * For small file uploads the client should group them together and call
 * [BatchUpdateBlobs][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.ContentAddressableStorage.BatchUpdateBlobs].
 * For large uploads, the client must use the
 * [Write method][google.bytestream.ByteStream.Write] of the ByteStream API. The
 * `resource_name` is `{instance_name}/uploads/{uuid}/blobs/{hash}/{size}`,
 * where `instance_name` is as described in the next paragraph, `uuid` is a
 * version 4 UUID generated by the client, and `hash` and `size` are the
 * [Digest][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Digest] of the blob. The
 * `uuid` is used only to avoid collisions when multiple clients try to upload
 * the same file (or the same client tries to upload the file multiple times at
 * once on different threads), so the client MAY reuse the `uuid` for uploading
 * different blobs. The `resource_name` may optionally have a trailing filename
 * (or other metadata) for a client to use if it is storing URLs, as in
 * `{instance}/uploads/{uuid}/blobs/{hash}/{size}/foo/bar/baz.cc`. Anything
 * after the `size` is ignored.
 * A single server MAY support multiple instances of the execution system, each
 * with their own workers, storage, cache, etc. The exact relationship between
 * instances is up to the server. If the server does, then the `instance_name`
 * is an identifier, possibly containing multiple path segments, used to
 * distinguish between the various instances on the server, in a manner defined
 * by the server. For servers which do not support multiple instances, then the
 * `instance_name` is the empty path and the leading slash is omitted, so that
 * the `resource_name` becomes `uploads/{uuid}/blobs/{hash}/{size}`.
 * When attempting an upload, if another client has already completed the upload
 * (which may occur in the middle of a single upload if another client uploads
 * the same blob concurrently), the request will terminate immediately with
 * a response whose `committed_size` is the full size of the uploaded file
 * (regardless of how much data was transmitted by the client). If the client
 * completes the upload but the
 * [Digest][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Digest] does not match, an
 * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error will be returned. In either case, the client should
 * not attempt to retry the upload.
 * For downloading blobs, the client must use the
 * [Read method][google.bytestream.ByteStream.Read] of the ByteStream API, with
 * a `resource_name` of `"{instance_name}/blobs/{hash}/{size}"`, where
 * `instance_name` is the instance name (see above), and `hash` and `size` are
 * the [Digest][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Digest] of the blob.
 * The lifetime of entries in the CAS is implementation specific, but it SHOULD
 * be long enough to allow for newly-added and recently looked-up entries to be
 * used in subsequent calls (e.g. to
 * [Execute][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Execution.Execute]).
 * As with other services in the Remote Execution API, any call may return an
 * error with a [RetryInfo][google.rpc.RetryInfo] error detail providing
 * information about when the client should retry the request; clients SHOULD
 * respect the information provided.

  /**

   * The CAS (content-addressable storage) is used to store the inputs to and
   * outputs from the execution service. Each piece of content is addressed by the
   * digest of its binary data.
   * Most of the binary data stored in the CAS is opaque to the execution engine,
   * and is only used as a communication medium. In order to build an
   * [Action][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Action],
   * however, the client will need to also upload the
   * [Command][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Command] and input root
   * [Directory][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Directory] for the Action.
   * The Command and Directory messages must be marshalled to wire format and then
   * uploaded under the hash as with any other piece of content. In practice, the
   * input root directory is likely to refer to other Directories in its
   * hierarchy, which must also each be uploaded on their own.
   * For small file uploads the client should group them together and call
   * [BatchUpdateBlobs][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.ContentAddressableStorage.BatchUpdateBlobs].
   * For large uploads, the client must use the
   * [Write method][google.bytestream.ByteStream.Write] of the ByteStream API. The
   * `resource_name` is `{instance_name}/uploads/{uuid}/blobs/{hash}/{size}`,
   * where `instance_name` is as described in the next paragraph, `uuid` is a
   * version 4 UUID generated by the client, and `hash` and `size` are the
   * [Digest][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Digest] of the blob. The
   * `uuid` is used only to avoid collisions when multiple clients try to upload
   * the same file (or the same client tries to upload the file multiple times at
   * once on different threads), so the client MAY reuse the `uuid` for uploading
   * different blobs. The `resource_name` may optionally have a trailing filename
   * (or other metadata) for a client to use if it is storing URLs, as in
   * `{instance}/uploads/{uuid}/blobs/{hash}/{size}/foo/bar/baz.cc`. Anything
   * after the `size` is ignored.
   * A single server MAY support multiple instances of the execution system, each
   * with their own workers, storage, cache, etc. The exact relationship between
   * instances is up to the server. If the server does, then the `instance_name`
   * is an identifier, possibly containing multiple path segments, used to
   * distinguish between the various instances on the server, in a manner defined
   * by the server. For servers which do not support multiple instances, then the
   * `instance_name` is the empty path and the leading slash is omitted, so that
   * the `resource_name` becomes `uploads/{uuid}/blobs/{hash}/{size}`.
   * When attempting an upload, if another client has already completed the upload
   * (which may occur in the middle of a single upload if another client uploads
   * the same blob concurrently), the request will terminate immediately with
   * a response whose `committed_size` is the full size of the uploaded file
   * (regardless of how much data was transmitted by the client). If the client
   * completes the upload but the
   * [Digest][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Digest] does not match, an
   * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error will be returned. In either case, the client should
   * not attempt to retry the upload.
   * For downloading blobs, the client must use the
   * [Read method][google.bytestream.ByteStream.Read] of the ByteStream API, with
   * a `resource_name` of `"{instance_name}/blobs/{hash}/{size}"`, where
   * `instance_name` is the instance name (see above), and `hash` and `size` are
   * the [Digest][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Digest] of the blob.
   * The lifetime of entries in the CAS is implementation specific, but it SHOULD
   * be long enough to allow for newly-added and recently looked-up entries to be
   * used in subsequent calls (e.g. to
   * [Execute][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Execution.Execute]).
