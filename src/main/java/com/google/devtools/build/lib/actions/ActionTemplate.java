/**
 * A placeholder action that, at execution time, expands into a list of {@link Action}s to be
 * executed.
 *
 * <p>ActionTemplate is for users who want to dynamically register Actions operating on individual
 * {@link TreeFileArtifact} inside input and output TreeArtifacts at execution time.
 *
 * <p>It takes in one TreeArtifact and generates one TreeArtifact. The following happens at
 * execution time for ActionTemplate:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Input TreeArtifact is resolved.
 *   <li>For each individual {@link TreeFileArtifact} inside input TreeArtifact, generate an output
 *       {@link TreeFileArtifact} inside output TreeArtifact.
 *   <li>For each pair of input and output {@link TreeFileArtifact}s, generate an associated {@link
 *       Action}.
 *   <li>All expanded {@link Action}s are executed and their output {@link TreeFileArtifact}s
 *       collected.
 *   <li>Output TreeArtifact is resolved.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of ActionTemplate must follow the contract of this interface and also make
 * sure:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>ActionTemplate instances should be immutable and side-effect free.
 *   <li>ActionTemplate inputs and outputs are supersets of the inputs and outputs of expanded
 *       actions, excluding inputs discovered at execution time. This ensures the ActionTemplate can
 *       properly represent the expanded actions at analysis time, and the action graph at analysis
 *       time is correct. This is important because the action graph is walked in a lot of places
 *       for correctness checks and build analysis.
 *   <li>The outputs of expanded actions must be under the output TreeArtifact and must not have
 *       artifact or artifact path prefix conflicts.
 * </ol>
