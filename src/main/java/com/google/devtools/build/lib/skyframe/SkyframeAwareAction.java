/**
 * Interface of an Action that is Skyframe-aware.
 *
 * <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: actions that implement this interface should override
 * {@code Action.executeUnconditionally} and return true. See below for details.
 *
 * <p>Implementors of this interface can request Skyframe dependencies to perform arbitrary
 * computation or establish desired dependencies before they are executed but after their inputs
 * have been built.
 *
 * <p>The {@link ActionExecutionFunction} will make sure that all requested SkyValues are built and
 * that the {@link SkyframeAwareAction#establishSkyframeDependencies(Environment)} function
 * completed successfully before attempting to execute the action.
 *
 * <p><b>It is crucial to correct action reexecution that implementors override
 * {@code Action.executeUnconditionally} to always return true.</b> Skyframe tracks changes in both
 * the input files and in dependencies established through
 * {@link #establishSkyframeDependencies(Environment)}, but the action cache only knows about the
 * input files. So if only the extra "skyframe dependencies" change, the action cache will believe
 * the action to be up-to-date and skip actual execution. Therefore it's crucial to bypass action
 * cache checking by marking the action as unconditionally executed.

   *
   * <p>This method should perform as little computation as possible: ideally it should request one
   * or a few SkyValues, perhaps set some state somewhere and return. If this method needs to
   * perform anything more complicated than that, including perhaps some non-trivial computation,
   * you should implement that as a SkyFunction and request the corresponding SkyValue in this
   * method.
   *
   * <p>Because the requested SkyValues may not yet be present in the graph, this method must be
   * safe to call multiple times, and should always leave the action object in a consistent state.
   *
   * <p>This method should not attempt to handle errors or missing dependencies (other than wrapping
   * exceptions); that is the responsibility of the caller. It should return as soon as possible,
   * ready to be called again at a later time if need be.
   *
   * <p>The return value will be incorporated into the
   * {@link com.google.devtools.build.lib.actions.ActionExecutionContext}.
