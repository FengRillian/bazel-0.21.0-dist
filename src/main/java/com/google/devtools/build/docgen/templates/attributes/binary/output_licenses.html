The licenses of the output files that this binary generates.
</p>

<p>
Describes the licenses of the output of the binary generated by
the rule. When a binary is referenced in a host attribute (for
example, the <code>tools</code> attribute of
a <code>genrule</code>), this license declaration is used rather
than the union of the licenses of its transitive closure. This
argument is useful when a binary is used as a tool during the
build of a rule, and it is not desirable for its license to leak
into the license of that rule. If this attribute is missing, the
license computation proceeds as if the host dependency was a
regular dependency.

<p>
<em class="harmful">WARNING: in some cases (specifically, in
genrules) the build tool cannot guarantee that the binary
referenced by this attribute is actually used as a tool, and is
not, for example, copied to the output. In these cases, it is the
responsibility of the user to make sure that this is
true.</em>
