# Apple apps and Bazel

This page contains resources that help you use Bazel to build macOS and iOS
projects. It links to a tutorial, build rules, and other information specific to
using Bazel to build and test for those platforms.

## Migrating to Bazel

If you currently build your macOS and iOS projects with Xcode, follow the steps
in the migration guide to start building them with Bazel:

*  [Migrating from Xcode to Bazel](migrate-xcode.html)

## Apple apps and new rules

**Note**: Creating new rules is for advanced build and test scenarios.
You do not need it when getting started with Bazel.
